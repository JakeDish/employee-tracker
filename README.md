This employee tracking application will allow users to view and manage their employees via node.js.
A series of prompts ask users what they need done and based on their responses they can view all departments, roles or employees, add new departments, roles or employees or update an existing employee's role within the company.
These changes are stored in a SQL database that allows easy access to make future changes.
